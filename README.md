Sorting Visualizer
======

It's a small Java application to show how various sorting algorithms work.
One can choose between different algorithms, sizes, and speeds.
Additionally, it's possible to measure the time for any algorithm on the chosen size.
There is also information about complexity and basic explanation for every algorithm


### Libraries

It is using only swing and awt.


### P.S.
Feel free to download/fork, use it or manipulate the code :)
